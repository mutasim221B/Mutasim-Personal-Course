The (tentative) course schedule below will be filled in throughout the semester. For each day, there will be written on what is due ahead of class time OR whats' the big thing (like quizzes!). The “Announcements” column is (hopefully) self-explanatory. Any urgent announcements will be made over email (moodle).

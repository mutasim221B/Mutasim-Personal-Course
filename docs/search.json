Statistical modeling is the art and science of turning data into information about such relationships of interest.\nBeing able to summarize, interpret, and communicate about data are crucial for navigating today’s information landscape, and these are precisely the skills that we’ll build in this class.

You can call me Bill or Professor Billah & I use he/him pronouns. Back when I was an undergrad student, I didn’t have the best experience in Intro Stat—those courses often emphasized formulas over real understanding. That experience has shaped my teaching—I concentrate on illustrating how statistical theories connect and can be applied in the real world. I’m excited to teach Introduction to Statistical Modeling and to create a more meaningful experience—one that helps all students feel confident applying it beyond the classroom. My methodological research lies at the intersection of statistical genetics, biostatistics, and genomics. My current research interests include developing novel statistical methods and computationally efficient bioinformatics tools, leveraging modern machine- and deep-learning approaches analyze high-dimensional next-generation sequencing and multi-omics data to identify genes and regulatory mechanisms underlying complex diseases. Outside of my academic work, I enjoy spending time outdoors with family and friends or cooking variety of foods. If you can’t find me anywhere, I might be busy playing soccer or exploring new worlds on my PS5 or PSVR!\n\n\nDrop-in (office) hours:\n\nLocation: My office\nTimes: M/W/F: 01:30-02:30 pm.\nBy Appointment: I’m also happy to meet one-on-one!

    "text": "About your GTAs\nWe have several wonderful GTAs this semester! Their role is to help students with content questions, assist in the navigation of available resources, advise on studying approaches, and assist with concepts, tools, and skills. Students are accountable for their own learning; as such, preceptors are not allowed to share answers to assignments (unless specifically directed by the instructor), they are not expected to immediately know the right approach to an exercise, and they do not provide assistance outside of office hours.\nIn hiring preceptors, we prioritize and emphasize kindness and respect. I expect the same of students in their interactions with the preceptors. Please utilize and respect their experience and commitment to supporting you in this course."

You may use AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, etc), with some caveats & limitations:\n\nAI is often wrong, thus is not a good resource on topics for which you don’t yet have expertise. Relatedly, though AI can be helpful with parts of a statistical analysis (eg: getting unstuck on code, checking grammar), you have to guide that process (eg: what questions are we trying to answer? what’s a reasonable approach?).\nWork on an exercise for at least 30 minutes before even thinking about AI. You will learn very little if you overly rely on AI, hence be unprepared for other interactions with the material (eg: in-class discussions, quizzes, future courses that build upon 155, etc). Learning comes from you doing the puzzling, not from you producing a correct answer.\nWhether or not you use AI, you must be able to defend/explain any code/discussion you hand in. You cannot simply use AI to bypass your own learning.\nYou may not use AI to generate entire arguments or discussions. Putting code and discussions into your own words is critical for your own deeper learning, independent thinking, and creativity. (For example, imagine how little you’d learn in a language course if you simply used AI to translate all text for you!!)\nAny use of AI must be cited, just like any other resource. Using AI without citation, to generate entire discussions / code blocks, or without being able to defend the results. Policy violations will result in a score of 0 on the work & be reported to the Asst. Dean of Academic Programs & Advising."

It is important to acknowledge any stressors you may be facing, which can be mental, emotional, physical, cultural, financial, etc., and how they can have an impact on you. I encourage you to remember that you have a body with needs. In the classroom, eat when you are hungry, drink water, use the restroom, and step out if you are upset and need some air. Please do what is necessary so long as it does not impede your or others’ ability to be mentally and emotionally present in the course.

    "text": "Model Assumptions\nOne way to think about model evaluation is to consider whether or not underlying assumptions of our regression models are being met (or not). Asking ourselves if our models are “wrong”, “strong”, and “fair” approaches this from one perspective. To the first question (whether our model is wrong), recall the following four assumptions of linear regression:\n\nLinearity\nIndependence\nNormality\nEqual Variance\n\nNote that they spell “LINE” (how convenient!).\nBy assumptions, we mean that the above four “things” are needed mathematically in order for linear regression to “work”.\nWhereas we can check some of these assumptions using a residual plot, we need to examine the context of our data collection when checking the Independence assumption. What we mean by independence, is that the residuals in our model do not depend on one another. This may seem like an unsatisfying definition, so here are some examples:\n\nSuppose I want to understand the association between a person’s high school GPA and their college GPA. I collect data from every graduating senior, at three different high schools. If I have college GPA as my outcome, and high school GPA as my predictor, are my residuals independent? Probably not! It is reasonable to believe that students from the same high school may have similar GPAs, due to resources their high school may have had available, or specific teachers grading differently at one school or another. This is an example of clustering, where we have clusters of students within schools. The independence assumption of our linear regression model would be violated. One way to address this would be to include which high school they went to as an additional covariate in our regression model (we’ll get to this with multiple linear regression), and more advanced methods are covered in a course on Correlated Data.\nSuppose I want to understand the association between a mouse’s weight and their water consumption across time. I collect data for 365 days for ten different mice, recording their weight and water consumption each day of the year. If I have weight as my predictor and water consumption as my outcome, are my residuals independent? Nope! This is an example of correlated data that is longitudinal in nature: I have multiple observations per individual (mouse) across time. A mouse’s weight one day is certainly not independent of it’s weight the following day. The independence assumption of our linear regression model would again be violated. One way to address this would be to include “Mouse ID” as a predictor in our regression model (again, we’ll get to this with multiple linear regression).\n\nAll types of data that will violate the independence assumption of linear regression will have some sort of correlation structure (within individual, across time, across space, etc.). Think about clusters. If your observations fall neatly into specific clusters, your data may violate the independence assumption of linear regression.\nFile organization: Save this file in the “Activities” subfolder of your “STAT155” folder."

    "text": "Exercise 5: Is the model strong? Developing R-squared intuition\nThe R-squared metric is a way to quantify the strength of a model. It measures how much variation in the outcome/response variable can be explained by the variation in the predictors.\nWhere does R-squared come from? Well, it turns out that we can partition the variance of the observed response values into the variability that’s explained by the model (the variance of the predictions) and the variability that’s left unexplained by the model (the variance of the residuals):\n\\[\\text{Var(observed) = Var(predicted) + Var(residuals)}\\]\nStrong models have residuals that don’t deviate far from 0. So the smaller the variance in the residuals (thus larger the variance in the predictions), the stronger the model. Take a look at the picture below and write a few sentences addressing the following:\n\nThe two rows of plots show a stronger and a weaker model. Just by looking at the blue trend line and the dispersion of the points about the line, which row corresponds to the stronger model? How can you tell? Which row would you expect to have a higher correlation?\nWhat is different about the variance of the residuals from the first to the second row?\n\n\nPutting this together, the R-squared compares Var(predicted) to Var(response):\n\\[R^2 = \\frac{\\text{variance of predicted values}}{\\text{variance of observed response values}} = 1 - \\frac{\\text{variance of residuals}}{\\text{variance of observed response values}}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nR-squared\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\nR^2 = 1 - \\frac{SSE}{SSTO} = 1 - \\frac{\\sum (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2}{\\sum (y_i - \\bar{y})^2}\n\\] where \\(y_i\\) are our observed outcomes, \\(i = 1, \\dots, n\\), \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) are our fitted values/predictions, and \\(\\bar{y}\\) is our observed average outcome."

Du Bois (1868–1963), a “sociologist, socialist, historian, civil rights activist, Pan-Africanist, author, writer, and editor”1, was a pioneer in elevating emotion and embodiment in data visualization. For the Paris World Fair of 1900, Du Bois and his team of students from Atlanta University presented 60 data visualizations of the Black experience in America, less than 50 years after the abolishment of slavery. To this end, Du Bois noted that “I wanted to set down its aim and method in some outstanding way which would bring my work to notice by the thinking world.” That is, he wanted to increase the impact of his work by partnering technical visualizations with design that better connects to lived experiences. Check out:\n\nAn article by Allen Hillery (@AlDatavizguy).\nA complete set of the data visualizations provided by Anthony Starks (@ajstarks).\n\nDiscuss your observations. In what ways do you think the W.E.B. Du Bois visualizations might have been more effective at sharing his work than, say, plainer bar charts?\nFOR A DEEPER DISCUSSION AND MORE MODERN EXAMPLES: Read Chapter 3 of Data Feminism on the principle of elevating emotion and embodiment, i.e. the value of “multiple forms of knowledge, including the knowledge that comes from people as living, feeling bodies in the world.”"

    "text": "Exercise 5: Is the model strong? Developing R-squared intuition\nThe R-squared metric is a way to quantify the strength of a model. It measures how much variation in the outcome/response variable can be explained by the model.\nWhere does R-squared come from? Well, it turns out that we can partition the variance of the observed response values into the variability that’s explained by the model (the variance of the predictions) and the variability that’s left unexplained by the model (the variance of the residuals):\n\\[\\text{Var(observed) = Var(predicted) + Var(residuals)}\\]\n“Good” models have residuals that don’t deviate far from 0. So the smaller the variance in the residuals (thus larger the variance in the predictions), the stronger the model. Take a look at the picture below and write a few sentences addressing the following:\n\nThe first row corresponds to the weaker model. We can tell because the points are much more dispersed from the trend line than in the second row. Recall that the correlation metric measures how closely clustered points are about a straight line of best fit, so we would expect the correlation to be lower for the first row than the second row.\nThe variance of the residuals is much lower for the second row—the residuals are all quite small. This indicates a stronger model."

    "text": "Exercise 3: Explore the relationship between ridership and temperature\nWe’d like to understand how daily ridership among registered users relates with the temperature that it feels like that day (temp_feel).\n\nWhat type of plot would be appropriate to visualize this relationship?

What do you notice? Is a simple linear regression model appropriate for this data?\n\n\n# Add a red straight line of best fit and a blue curve of best fit\nYOUR_PLOT +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n    geom_smooth(color = \"blue\", se = FALSE)\n\nWhat do you think “eval = TRUE/FALSE” doing here {r eval = TRUE/FALSE}?\n\n# Add a red straight line of best fit and a blue curve of best fit\nggplot(bikes, aes(x = temp_feel, y = riders_registered)) +\n    geom_point() +\n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n    geom_smooth(color = \"blue\", se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComments: If we only displayed the red line of best fit on the plot, we might miss the slight downward trend at the highest temperatures that we can see more clearly with the blue curve of best fit. A linear model is not appropriate if fit to the whole range of the data, but there does seem to be a linear relationship between ridership and temperature below 80 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nCompute Correlation of temp_feel and riders_registered.\n\n\nCorrelation\nWe can quantify the linear relationship between two quantitative variables using a numerical summary known as correlation (sometimes known as a “correlation coefficient” or “Pearson’s correlation”). Correlation can range from -1 to 1, where a correlation of 0 indicates that there is no linear relationship between the two quantitative variables.\nBelow is an example of a “Math Box”. You’ll see these occasionally throughout the activities. You are not required to memorize, nor will you be assessed on, anything in the math boxes. If you plan on continuing with Statistics courses at Macalester (or are interested in the math behind everything!), these math boxes are for you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient, \\(r_{x, y}\\), of \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) is the (almost) average of products of the z-scores of variables \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\\[\nr_{x, y} = \\frac{\\sum z_x z_y}{n - 1}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIn general, we will want to be able to describe (qualitatively) two aspects of correlation:\n\nStrength\n\n\nIs the correlation between x and y strong, or weak, i.e. how closely do the points fit around a line? This has to do with how dispersed our point clouds are.\n\n\nDirection\n\n\nIs the correlation between x and y positive or negative, i.e. does y go “up” when x goes “up” (positive), or does y go “down” when x goes “up” (negative)?\n\nStronger correlations will be further from 0 (closer to -1 or 1), and positive and negative correlations will have the appropriate respective sign (above or below zero).\nWhiteboard Time (a little-bit!)\n\n# correlation\n\n# Note: the order in which you put your two quantitative variables into the cor\n# function doesn't matter!

Go back to using the bikes dataset (instead of bikes_sub) because we no longer need to only keep days less than 80 degrees.\n\n# Construct and interpret a visualization of this relationship\n# Include a representation of the relationship trend\nggplot(bikes, aes(x = windspeed, y = riders_registered)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"red\", se = FALSE) +\n    geom_smooth(color = \"blue\", se = FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Use lm to construct a model of riders_registered vs windspeed\n# Save this as bike_mod2\nbike_mod2 &lt;- lm(riders_registered ~ windspeed, data = bikes)\n\n# Get a short summary of this model\ncoef(summary(bike_mod2))\n##               Estimate Std.

(0 is a little below the minimum of the observed data, but not by much! So extrapolation in interpreting the intercept isn’t a huge concern.)\nSlope: Every 1mph increase in windspeed is associated with a ridership decrease of 65 riders on average.\n\nSee the code below to predict ridership on August 17, 2012 and calculate the corresponding residual. Note that this residual is smaller than the residual from the temperature model (that residual was 3496.731). This indicates that August 17 was more of an outlier in ridership given the temperature than the windspeed.\n\n\nbikes %&gt;% \n    filter(date == \"2012-08-17\") %&gt;% \n    select(riders_registered, windspeed)\n## # A tibble: 1 × 2\n##   riders_registered windspeed\n##               &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n## 1              5665      15.5\n\n# prediction\n4490.09761 - 65.34145 * 15.50072\n## [1] 3477.258\n\n# residual \n5665 - 3477.258\n## [1] 2187.742",

    "text": "Exercise 8: Limitations of correlation\nWe previously noted that correlation was a numerical summary of the linear relationship between two variables. We’ll now go through some examples of relationships between quantitative variables to demonstrate why it is incredibly important to visualize our data in addition to just computing numerical summaries!\nFor this exercise, we’ll be working with the anscombe dataset, which is built in to R. To load this dataset into our environment, we run the following code:\n\n# load anscombe data\ndata(\"anscombe\")\n\nThe anscombe dataset contains four different pairs of quantitative variables:\n\nx1, y1\nx2, y2\nx3, y3\nx4, y4\n\nAdapt the code we used in Exercise 7 to compute the correlation between each of these four pairs of variables, below:\n\n# correlation between x1, y1\n\n# correlation between x2, y2\n\n# correlation between x3, y3\n\n# correlation between x4, y4\n\n\nWhat do you notice about each of these correlations (if the answer to this isn’t obvious, double-check your code)?\nDescribe these correlations in terms of strength and direction, using only the numerical summary to assist you in your description.\nDraw an example on the white board or at your tables of what you think the point clouds for these pairs of variables might look like. There are only 11 observations, so you can draw all 11 points if you’d like!\nAdapt the code for scatterplots given previously in this activity to make four distinct scatterplots for each pair of quantitative variables in the anscombe dataset. You do not need to add a smooth trend line or a linear trend line to these plots.\n\n\n# scatterplot: x1, y1\n\n# scatterplot: x2, y2\n\n# scatterplot: x3, y3\n\n# scatterplot: x4, y4\n\n\nBased on the correlations you calculated and scatterplots you made, what is the message of this last exercise as it relates to the limits of correlation?"

    "text": "Exercise 9: Lines of best fit\nIn this activity, we’ve learned how to fit straight lines to data, to help us visualize the relationship between two quantitative variables. So far, ggplot has chosen the line for us. How does it know which line is “best”, and what does “best” even mean?\nFor this exercise, we’ll consider the relationship between x1 and y1 in the anscombe dataset. Run the following code, which creates a scatterplot with a fitted line to our data using the function geom_abline:\n\n# scatterplot with a fitted line, whose slope is 0.4 and intercept is 3\nanscombe %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(slope = 0.4, intercept = 3, col = \"blue\", size = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe the line that you see. Do you think the line is “good”? What are you using to define “good”?\nSome things to think about:\n\nHow many points are above the line?\nHow many points are below the line?\nAre the distances of the points above and below the line roughly similar, or is there meaningful difference?\n\nNow we’ll add another line to our plot. Which line do you think is better suited for this data? Why? Be specific!\n\n# scatterplot with a fitted line, whose slope is 0.4 and intercept is 3\nanscombe %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(slope = 0.4, intercept = 3, col = \"blue\", size = 1) +\n  geom_abline(slope = 0.5, intercept = 4, col = \"orange\", size = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s usually quite simple to note when a line is bad, but more difficult to quantify when a line is a good fit for our data. Consider the following line:\n\n# scatterplot with a fitted line, whose slope is 0.4 and intercept is 3\nanscombe %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(slope = -0.5, intercept = 10, col = \"red\", size = 1) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the next activity, we’ll formalize the principle of least squares, which will give us one particular definition of a line of best fit that is commonly used in statistics! We’ll take advantage of the vertical distances between each point and the fitted line (residuals), which will help us define (mathematically) a line that best fits our data:\n\nlibrary(broom)\nanscombe %&gt;%\n  lm(y1 ~ x1, data = .) %&gt;%\n  augment() %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = x1, y = y1)) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = x1, yend = .fitted), col = \"red\") +\n  geom_point()"
